          <p>Our team came up with an idea for customers who want to go on vacation to build their own. If you can build your pizzaâ€¦ why can't you build your vacation? We wanted to incorporate a unique aspect to planning a vacation based on personal preferences. Users can read about various destinations and select the characteristics of a vacation they would like to take.</p>

          <h3>Explore:</h3>
          <p>The explore page lets customers discover 5 different places and their attractions, including Paris, New York, London, Istanbul, and Hong Kong. It is a sneak peek into what their vacation could look like if they so choose to travel there. At the top of each destination, a price is given for how much a flight would cost to travel round-trip from the US.  Each of those 5 destinations has a list of 10 excursions that vacationers are able to visit. Along with the excursions, there is a price breakdown of the amount each excursion costs.
Our team thought that this page would help customers find out more information about a destination before they travel.
</p>
          <h3>Build Your Vacation:</h3>
          <p>This page allows customers to select their dream destination based on the activities they would like to experience. A customer can choose between two recreational activities that include a river trip, hiking, a park, a museum, a theatre, or an amusement park. They can then select a type of landmark they would like to see on their vacation, varying from a church or temple, a market, a statue, a palace, or a bridge. And finally, a customer can choose whether they want a warm location or a cooler location. When generated, they will have 1 of the 5 vacations on our explore page picked out. If they like their answer, they can add it to the cart. 
Our team thought that this page would help our customer figure out their perfect vacation. 
</p>
          <h3>Cart:</h3>
          <p>Our cart page lets a customer check out with their vacation. They do this by entering their first and last name, email, phone number, creating a username and password, and their address.
